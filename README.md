Toptyp is an authenticator app for Windows. It will let you...

 - Set up two-factor authentication for your accounts by scanning QR codes.
 - Generate and copy QR codes quickly -- one mouse click or a few key presses.
 - Back up and restore your account secrets, either password-protected or not.
 - Print out your account information as QR codes.

Toptyp does not sync or send your account information anywhere. Backups are in your hands, although it will remind you to make one after you make a change.

Toptyp is lightweight, starting nearly instantly and using less than 2MB of memory. To use most efficiently, open the program, type a few characters of the account you need into the already-focused search box, and press Enter to copy the code.
